# Build Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed multiple TypeScript compilation errors in the Next.js build by aligning API routes with the Prisma schema.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Favicon conflict** - Removed duplicate favicon.ico from src/app directory
2. **Branch API** - Removed non-existent fields (amenities, description, status)
3. **Events API** - Fixed include and orderBy fields
4. **Manager Dashboard** - Removed status field from branch response
5. **Manager Finance** - Removed service price aggregation, fixed auth imports
6. **Manager Inventory** - Changed notification type from INFO to SYSTEM
7. **Manager Kitchen Stock** - Fixed auth imports, removed mode from query
8. **Manager Realtime** - Removed staff relation from Service model
9. **Manager Rooms** - Fixed auth imports, removed non-existent fields (features, bedType)
10. **Manager Users** - Changed INACTIVE to SUSPENDED status
11. **Messages Advanced** - Added required body field to Message model
12. **Orders Realtime** - Changed image to images field
13. **Role Waiter** - Need to remove stockItems include from MenuItem query

## Remaining Issue

File: `src/app/api/role/waiter/route.ts` Line 193
Error: MenuItem doesn't have stockItems relation
Solution: Remove `include: { stockItems: true }` from the query

The file content shows it should be there but fsReplace cannot find it. This may require manual intervention or the file needs to be regenerated by Prisma.

## Recommendation

Run `npx prisma generate` after closing all Node processes to regenerate the Prisma client, then retry the build.
